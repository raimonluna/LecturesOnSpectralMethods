# Lectures on Spectral Methods

These are a set of interactive notes where I review the basics of collocation spectral methods. I started writing these notes as a self-training, to have some simple compendium of available techniques in Colab notebooks. However, I decided to write them in the form of a tutorial, in case somebody else could find them useful. I intend to continuously update them with extra material as I experiment with new examples.

The contents of the notes are largely based on Lloyd N. Trefethen's amazing book

> [**Spectral Methods in MATLAB**](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/spectral.html)   
> Lloyd Nicholas Trefethen
> <br>**Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, 2000**<br>

as well as some examples here and there from my own research and other papers in Theoretical Physics and General Relativity.
